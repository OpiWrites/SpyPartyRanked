Hi! Welcome to SpyParty Ranked. To get started, all you have to do is download the SpyPartyRanked.zip file!

## How to install

Windows:
1. Download the `SpyPartyRanked2.0.zip` file and place it anywhere you like.
2. Unzip and go into the `SpyPartyRanked2.0` folder and run `SpyPartyRankedv2.0.exe`. To check to make sure it is running, find the program in Task Manager. There will be two processes.

Linux & MacOS:
1. Download a copy of this repository from github: [SpyPartyRanked.zip](https://github.com/OpiWrites/SpyPartyRanked/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
2. Unzip this directory, and run the `SpyPartyRankedv2.0` script.

After that, you're done! Now any time you'd like to play a ranked match in SpyParty, simply type `"RANKEDON"` in your chat window while in a match. This will flag that match as being ranked. Note that your opponent will also have to have the program and type the key phrase to actually update your ranked score.

## Some notes
* The program will only upload your results once you close SpyParty. Once you close SpyParty, please wait about 15 seconds to re-open it, as the program checks to see if it can access the log every 15 seconds.
* You can play multiple ranked sets in one instance of SpyParty, and they will be uploaded in the order you played them.
* Please ensure that you and your opponent both flag that the match is ranked at the same time. "The same time" in this case is before any games have been completed; if you flag a set as ranked, play a game, and then your opponent flags the set as ranked, the program will not be able to verify the set correctly.
* If you have any issues, please ping @OpiWrites on the SpyParty discord, or send me an email at opilordtime@gmail.com so I can look into it.
* If you want to look at the rankings leaderboards, you can check them out over at https://www.spypartyfans.com/ranked
* Ranked sets must be 12 games long. Players are strongly encouraged to use a fair drafting method, and to play competitive setups.
